# How to request a review

How to initiate the review process depends on where you updated the content.

## Edited single file in browser

If you followed the instructions to [edit a file on GitHub][1], you've already created the pull request.

Wait for a notification from the reviewer. Then [view and incorporate feedback on the pull request][5].

## Worked on a local branch

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD044 -->
* If you worked on a branch from a [clone][2], go directly to [the public superoffice-docs repo][4].
* If you worked on a [fork][3], go to your **forked GitHub repo** on GitHub.com instead.

[!include[Steps to create a PR](../includes/steps-create-pr.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> There are extensions for creating PRs directly from VS Code, however, authentication (especially with enterprise accounts) is not trivial. Creating PRs on GitHub is strongly recommended.

## What happens now?

* Follow the discussion in the **Conversation** tab.
* Look for GitHub notifications on the PR and be prepared to [implement the requested changes][5] (if any).
