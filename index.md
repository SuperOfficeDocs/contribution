# Contribute to SuperOfficeDocs

Thanks for being awesome & contributing to SuperOffice Docs! Our community is better because of your contributions... let's get started.

## SuperOfficeDocs on GitHub

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. If you're not familiar with Git and/or GitHub, no worries! Having our documentation center on GitHub brings many benefits to our community as we can now build SuperOffice documentation in the open, together, as a community. If you see areas for improvement or gaps in the documentation, you can easily update and/or fill those gaps. SuperOffice Docs will be a living and breathing, community-generated, collection of awesome learning materials moving forward.

SuperOffice Docs are located on GitHub at [https://github.com/SuperOfficeDocs][1].

## How SuperOfficeDocs are generated

The SuperOffice Docs system uses [DocFx][2], [Markdown][3], and GitHub to ultimately output a statically generated site, which is currently located at [docs.superoffice.com][4]. You don't have to understand the components that are used to generate the docs to contribute.

## Authoring and editing content in SuperOfficeDocs

There are 2 primary ways to contribute to the documentation on this website. SuperOffice Docs can be updated in the browser in GitHub and also locally on one's machine. The latter is only necessary if you're making complex edits and maybe are more technical.

### Editing in GitHub

If you are just updating text, typos, or adding a few sentences it may be easiest to edit the content directly from GitHub's browser. If you wish to edit directly in the browser check out the [edit SuperOfficeDocs online in GitHub][5] guide. Be sure to also check out the [Markdown Guide to DocFX][6] to ensure you're formatting the code correctly, and also know that we are using the [Markdig][7] processor, which added more markdown capabilities.

### Editing using DocFX

If you are making more complex edits you may want to [get SuperOfficeDocs running on your local machine][8]. In this case, after getting SuperOfficeDocs running locally, you'll follow the [edit SuperOfficeDocs locally][9] guide.
