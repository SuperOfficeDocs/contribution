# Code of conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of this project pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, technical preferences, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

### Be friendly and welcoming

* Listen with purpose and create space for others' communication preferences.
* Ask yourself how you can make someone else's like easier.

### Be patient

* Remember that people have varying communication styles and preferences.
* Recognize that not everyone is using the their native language - meaning and tone can be lost in translation.

### Be thoughtful

* Think about how others will interpret your words - productive, clear communication requires efforts!
* Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.

### Be respectful and inclusive

* Respect differences of opinion.
* Seek to build bridges and understand, not condemn or criticize.
* Make a conscious effort to include people who differ from you.

### Be open and curious

* Assume good intent and interpret others' statements or questions in good faith.
* Ask questions to understand, not denounce.
* Focus on continuous learning - get better at the things you already know, tackle completely new things, and ask others about there expertise to deepen yours.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within spaces involving this project and in other spaces involving community members. This includes the repository, its Pull Requests and Issue tracker, its [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sodevnet) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SODevNet) community, private email communications in the context of the project, and any events where members of the project are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the project's members.

Depending on the violation, the maintainers may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

## When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s) or commits.
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesnâ€™t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, contact the maintainers.
4. As soon as available, a maintainer will look into the issue, and take further action, starting with a warning, then temporary block, then long-term repo or organization ban.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

## Other Community Standards

Enforcement of those guidelines after violations overlapping with the above are the responsibility of the entities, and enforcement may happen in any or all of the services/communities.
