# Edit an article in the browser

The easiest way to edit a SuperOffice Doc file is to edit it in the browser on GitHub.com.

## The Steps

1. Find any file in the SuperOfficeDocs repo that you want to edit. The file will typically reside in a sub-folder of the *docs** folder (it may be a few levels down) and it will most likely be an *index.md* file.

2. Click the **Edit** button icon.
