# Edit an article in the browser

The easiest way to edit a SuperOffice Docs file is to edit it in the browser on GitHub.com.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on an existing issue, self-assign. Otherwise, first, please create a new issue. Reference the issue ID in both the branch name, commit messages, and pull request.

## The steps

1. Find any file in the SuperOfficeDocs repo that you want to edit. The file will typically reside in a sub-folder of the *docs** folder (it may be a few levels down) and it will most likely be an *index.md* file.

2. Click the **Edit** button.
